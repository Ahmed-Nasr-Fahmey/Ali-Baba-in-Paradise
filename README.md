# Ali Baba in Paradise

## Description

The "Ali Baba in Paradise" project follows Ali Baba and his team of thieves as they venture into a cave filled with various types of items. Their goal is to strategically select items to maximize their profit while ensuring the total weight of the chosen items remains within the constraints of their camels' maximum load.

## Problem Statement

Ali Baba and his team have the freedom to choose any type of item and any number of instances of that item. Each item type is associated with a weight and a profit value. Their primary objective is to optimize the selection of items to achieve the highest possible profit while ensuring that the total weight of the chosen items does not exceed the maximum load capacity of their camels.

## Key Features

- **Item Selection Strategy**: Develop a strategy to select a combination of items that maximizes overall profit while adhering to weight constraints.

- **Infinite Instances**: Account for the fact that Ali Baba and his team can select the same item more than once (there are infinite instances of each item).

## Implementation

The project involves implementing two essential functions:

1. **1st Function: Maximum Profit**: Develop a function that returns the maximum profit achievable while ensuring the total weight of the chosen items remains within the camel's maximum load.

2. **2nd Function: Item Selection**: Implement a function that returns the selected item(s) (if any) and the number of instances chosen from each item.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in the "Ali Baba in Paradise" project, participants will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Develop problem-solving skills in optimizing resource allocation under constraints.

- Gain experience in designing algorithms to maximize profits while considering weight limitations and infinite instances of items.

- Understand the importance of strategic decision-making in resource optimization scenarios.

## Outcome

Upon completion, participants will have a functional "Ali Baba in Paradise" algorithm that showcases their ability to optimize resource selection for maximum profit within defined weight constraints. This project emphasizes skills in algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and efficient utilization of resources, which are valuable in various domains such as operations research, finance, and logistics.
